Rethinkdb migration tool

## Acknowledgement

This tool is highly inspired by, or, should I say, is a rewrite of, Johan Ã–brink's
[`rethink-migrate`](https://github.com/JohanObrink/rethink-migrate). Unfortunately,
`rethink-migrate` got stale. This is an attempt to improve the code and tests,
track test coverage, update syntax to ES2015 and enhance functionality.

## Install

You can either install `rethinkdb-migrate` globally:

```shell
npm install -g rethinkdb-migrate
```

Or define a `npm script` for migration and install `rethinkdb-migrate` locally:

```shell
npm install rethinkdb-migrate
```

In `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "migrate": "rethinkdb-migrate"
  }
}
```

In this last case, `rethinkdb-migrate` should be run as:

```shell
npm run migrate <commands>
```

All examples will consider that `rethinkdb-migrate` is installed globally.

## Usage

There are currently three operations supported by `rethinkdb-migrate`:

Operation | Command | Description
---|---|---
create | `rethinkdb-migrate create <migration-name>` | Creates a migration with the given name
up | `rethinkdb-migrate up` | Runs all un-executed migrations up
down | `rethinkdb-migrate down` | Runs all executed migrations down

### Create

```shell
$ rethinkdb-migrate create <migration name>
```

This operation creates a migration template file, where the database changes should be made.

The template exports two functions, `up` and `down`, that receive an instance of the rethinkdb driver and a connection object. These functions **must** return a `Promise`.

Running `rethinkdb-migrate create new-migration` will create a file `YYYYMMDDHHmmss-new-migration.js` in the directory `./migrations`. Do not change the filename in any way after creating it.

Migrations template:

```javascript
'use strict'

exports.up = function (r, connection) {
  // must return a Promise!
}

exports.down = function (r, connection) {
  // must return a Promise!
}
```

Migration example:

```javascript
'use strict'

exports.up = function (r, connection) {
  return Promise.all([
    r.tableCreate('companies').run(connection),
    r.tableCreate('employees').run(connection)
  ])
}

exports.down = function (r, connection) {
  return Promise.all([
    r.tableDrop('companies').run(connection), r.tableDrop('employees').run(connection)
  ])
}
```

### Up

```shell
$ rethinkdb-migrate up --db=mydb
```

This command will run all pending migrations up, in order of creation. See
[Options](#options) section to configure this task.

### Down

```shell
$ rethinkdb-migrate down --db=mydb
```

This command will run all `down` steps from migrations that have been run
previously. See [Options](#options) section to configure this task.

### Options

The following options can be passed to `rethinkdb-migrate`:

Option name | Default value | Description
---|---|---
driver | `rethinkdb` | Rethinkdb javascript driver. Can be either `rethinkdb` or `rethinkdbdash`.
host | `localhost` | The host to connect to, if using rethinkdb official driver.
port | `28015` | The port to connect on, if using rethinkdb official driver.
db | None, this is required | Database name.
user | `''` | Rethinkdb user
username | `''` | Rethinkdb username
password | `''` | Rethinkdb password
authKey | `''` | Rethinkdb authKey
discovery | `false` | Whether or not the driver should try to keep a list of updated hosts. Only available when using `rethinkdbdash` driver
pool | `false` | Whether or not to use a connection pool when using `rethinkdbdash` driver.
cursor | `true` | If true, cursors will not be automatically converted to arrays when using `rethinkdbdash`.
servers | undefined | Array of `{ host, port }` of servers to connect to. Only available when using `rethinkdbdash`
migrationsDirectory | `migrations` | Directory where migration files will be saved
relativeTo | `process.cwd()` | Root path from which migration directory will be searched or created (if inexistent)'
migrationsTable | `_migrations` | Table where meta information about migrations will be saved. This should only be changed if you need a \_migrations table in your application

Options can be passed to the script in three different ways:

- Via environment variables
- Via configuration files
- Via command line arguments

Command line options take precedence over all other forms of passing options.
Configuration file options take precedence over environment variables.

#### Passing options via environment variables

```shell
$ db=mydb rethinkdb-migrate up
```

#### Passing options via configuration file

Create a file that exports the options object (can be either a javascript file
exporting an object, or a JSON file)


```javascript
// config.js file

module.exports = {
  db: "mydb",
  driver: "rethinkdbdash",
  pool: true,
  servers: [
    { host: "localhost", port: 28015 },
    { host: "localhost", port: 28016 }
  ]
}
```

```shell
$ rethinkdb-migrate up -f config.js
```


#### Passing options via command line arguments

```shell
$ rethinkdb-migrate down --db=mydb --host=127.0.0.1 --port=28016
```

## Contributing

Feel free to suggest improvements and to open PRs. Please add/modify tests to
maintain high coverage. Also, code must follow
[standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) style.

### Running tests:

- Install [rethinkdb](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/)
- Make sure you have two instances of rethinkdb in a cluster:

```shell
$ rethinkdb

# in another terminal session:
$ rethinkdb --port-offset 1 --directory rethinkdb_data2 --join localhost:29015
```
- Clone this repo
- Make sure you are running node version >= 6
- `npm install`
- `npm test`
